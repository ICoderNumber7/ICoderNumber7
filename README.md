- 👋 Hi, I’m @ICoderNumber7
- 👀 I’m interested in coding and being part of the coding community
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Game Development and Programming in Java script, Python and C#
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on many projects but mostly the ones related to game development
- I'm really hoping to fit into the community and learn something here so... wish me good luck I guess...
